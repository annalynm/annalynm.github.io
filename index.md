# Welcome to annalynm's homepage!

This is website serves as my online portfolio for coding projects. Feel free to bookmark it to stay up to date on my projects.

## About Me

I am a current PhD student with next to no coding experience (I managed to drag my feet through a class on HTML & CSS long enough to code a website in undergrad, but I don't count that.) I've recently become interested in learning python, and I've been working on small projects to help with that process. Here are some of the projects that I've worked on so far!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/annalynm/annalynm.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
