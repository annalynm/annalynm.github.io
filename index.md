## About Me

I am a current PhD student with next to no coding experience. 
I managed to drag my feet through a class on HTML & CSS long enough to code a website in undergrad, and I worked as a Data Analyst where I only occasionally cried about mySQL... but I really don't count that. 
I've recently become interested in learning python, and I've been working on small projects to help with that process. Here are some of the projects that I've worked on so far!

### Recent Projects

I began learning the basics of python coding during the Fall semester using Codeacademy. 
While on Christmas break I've had time to work on actual projects using video tutorials and online resources. 
Here are the projects I have completed as of end of 2020.

**1. [Christmas Tree](https://github.com/annalynm/Christmas-Tree)**

My first project consisted of animating a Christmas tree with blinking colored lights.

**2. [Snow Animation](https://github.com/annalynm/Let-It-Snow)**

 For my second project, I animated snow falling over a background picture of a snowman. 
 I set the program to ask what the temperature that day was and to print a different response depending on if it was warm or cold before playing the animation.
 This was a Christmas gift for my mom, so I also had it print "MERRY CHRISTMAS!" at the top of the screen.     

**3. [Pong](https://github.com/annalynm/Pong)**

My third project was to recreate Pong using python turtle. The initial version I produced is functional, but I want to improve it and add fun features. I intend to add updated versions of Pong in the future with descriptions of what I have changed.

**4. [Pacman](https://github.com/annalynm/Pacman)**

After finishing Pong, I was interested in exploring similar but more complex projects. I enjoy project-based learning and especially liked working on a project where I was familiar with what the end product was suppose to be like. I found (www.pacmancode.com) and thought recreating Pacman would be a fun challenge to end my holiday break with.
